## Description 
This a laboratory equiptment booking system designed for a user to be able to book all-day slots for up to 14 days in advance. The booking system consists of two classes: `BookingWindow` and  `BookingDatabase`. When the booking system is set up for the first time, the `BookingWindow` tkinter pgraphical interface accepts the name of the apparatus, the date of the first bookable all-day slot, a list of users to make bookings, and a list of the users' departmental affiliations. As the system is set up for the first time, `x()` is called to create 14 all-day slots,; and a `create_log()` method including an error log for the BookingDatabase and BookingWindow classes. Thereafter, whenever the system is initialised `x()` is called to maintain the number of bookable slots in the database, so that as time passes the user will always be able to book a slot for up to 14 days ahead; `x()` is called t0 display a calendar to the user with an overview of booked and available of the next 14 all-day slots; and `x()`, `x()`, and `x()` are also called to launch widgets for the user to interact with to make and cancel bookings. When the user makes a booking by selecting name, departmental affilication, and an available date, `x()` and `x()` are called to make a booking. When the user enters the booking reference into the, `x()` is called to cancel the booking.       

The methods of the `BookingDatabase` class are called from `BookingWindow`. `create_table()` creates an empty SQLite database table for holding bookings of all-day slots; `create_slots()` creates bookable all-day slots in the table; `create_booking()` creates a booking in the table by updating of an existing available all-day slot, thus rendering the slot unavailable by booking to other users; `delete_booking()` deletes a booking by updating a booked all-day slot in the table, thus making the slot available for booking again; `get_slots_available()` returns the last n available all-day slots in the table; `get_slots_calendar_display()` returns the last n all-day slots in the table; `get_slots_all()` returns all all-day slots in the sqlite database table; `get_slots_last()` returns the last (most recently created) all-day slot in the table; and `is_booking_reference_unique()` returns None when the booking reference is unique.
