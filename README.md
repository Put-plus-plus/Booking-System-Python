## Description 
A laboratory equiptment booking system for booking of all-day slots for up to 14 days in advance. The system consists of the `BookingWindow` class that holds the graphical user interface, and the `BookingDatabase` class that holds the SQLite database. To initialise the system for the first time, `BookingWindow` accepts the name of the apparatus, the date of the first bookable all-day slot, a list of user names, and a list of the users' affiliations; `create_log()` is called to create an error log for the system, and `x()` is called to create 14 all-day slots.  Thereafter, when the system is initialised `x()` is called to maintain the number of bookable slots in the database, so that as time passes the user will always be able to book a slot for up to 14 days ahead; and `x()` is called t0 display a calendar to the user with an overview of the next 14 all-day slots; and `x()`, `x()`, and `x()` are  called to launch widgets for the user interaction. If the user interact with the widgets to make a booking, `x()` is called to make the booking, which also calls `x()` to create a booking reference unique to the booking. If the user interacts with the widgets to cancel a booking by enterring a booking reference into the appropriate widget, `x()` is called to cancel the booking.       

The methods of the `BookingDatabase` class are called from `BookingWindow`. `create_table()` creates an empty SQLite database table for holding bookings of all-day slots; `create_slots()` creates bookable all-day slots in the table; `create_booking()` creates a booking in the table by updating of an existing available all-day slot, thus rendering the slot unavailable by booking to other users; `delete_booking()` deletes a booking by updating a booked all-day slot in the table, thus making the slot available for booking again; `get_slots_available()` returns the last n available all-day slots in the table; `get_slots_calendar_display()` returns the last n all-day slots in the table; `get_slots_all()` returns all all-day slots in the sqlite database table; `get_slots_last()` returns the last (most recently created) all-day slot in the table; and `is_booking_reference_unique()` returns None when the booking reference is unique.

## Execution - booking system example   
```python
from booking_system import *

sorter_apparatus_name = 'BDFACSMelody'

BookingWindow(sorter_apparatus_name, sorter_booking_name, sorter_booking_department, sorter_first_slot_date)
```
