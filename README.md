## Description 
This is a laboratory equiptment booking system for the booking of all-day slots for up to 14 days in advance. The system consists of the `BookingWindow` class that holds the graphical user interface, and the `BookingDatabase` class that holds the SQLite database. The system is set up by passing the name of the eqiptment, a list of users, a list of the users' departmental affiliations, and the the date of the first bookable all-day slot into `BookingWindow`. `BookingWindow` has 11 methods: `create_log()`creates an error log for the system; `create_initial_slots()` creates 14 all-day slots the first time the system is initialised; `create_additional_slots()` maintains the number of bookable slots in the database, so that as time passes the user is always able to book an all-day slot for up to 14 days ahead; `display_calendar()` displays a calendar to the user so to provide an overview of the availability of the next 14 all-day slots; `launch_labels()`, `launch_menus()`, and `launch_buttons()` and `launch_entries()` launch widgets for user interaction; `create_booking_ref()` creates a booking reference unique to a booking; `make_booking()` creates a booking with the output from `create_booking_ref()` and user input from widgets, and also displays the unique booking reference to the user; `cancel_booking()` cancels a booking by accepting the unique booking reference as user input from a widget. The `BookingDatabase` class  has nine methods and they are called from the `BookingWindow` class: `create_table()` creates an empty SQLite database table for holding bookings of all-day slots; `create_slots()` creates available all-day slots in the table; `create_booking()` creates a booking in the table by updating of an existing available all-day slot, thus rendering the slot unavailable for booking; `is_booking_reference_unique()` querries the table and returns None when the booking reference is unique; `delete_booking()` deletes a booking by updating a booked all-day slot in the table, thus making the slot available for booking again; and `get_slots_available()`, `get_slots_calendar_display()`, `get_slots_all()` and `get_slots_last()` retrieve all-day slots from the table.
